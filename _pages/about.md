I am now a fourth-year PhD student in [Centre for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/) and [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My research interests are combinatorial algorithms, computational complexity, and learning theory. My Ph.D. advisor is [Miklos Santha](https://www.irif.fr/~santha/).

I am looking for a PostDoc position starting soon.

My Erd≈ës number is [3](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freetools/collab-dist?source=1525495&target=189017).

## Research Interests

+ Combinatorial algorithms.
+ Quantum query complexity.
+ Learning theory.

## Papers

1. **On quantum time complexity of divide and conquer**
   Joint work with Jonathan Allcock, Aleksandrs Belovs, Troy Lee and Miklos Santha
   Talk at QIP2024[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vc9FzULV_E)
3. **Constant-depth circuits for Uniformly Controlled Gates and Boolean functions with application to quantum memory circuits**
4. **Fundamental theorem for quantum asset pricing**
5. **Quantum algorithm for stochastic optimal stopping problems with applications in finance**[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15332)
