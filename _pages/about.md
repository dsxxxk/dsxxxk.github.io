## Short Bio

I am a research assistant in CQT, NUS working with [Patrick Rebentrost](https://www.quantumlah.org/people/profile/Frank-Patrick).
Previously, I obtained my PhD degree from [Centre for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/) and [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My research interests are combinatorial algorithms, computational complexity, and learning theory. My Ph.D. advisor is [Miklos Santha](https://www.irif.fr/~santha/).

My Erd≈ës number is [3](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freetools/collab-dist?source=1525495&target=189017).

## Research Interests

+ Algorithms: graph-theoretic algorithms, string problems and combinatorial optimization
+ Complexity: query complexity, time complexity and communication complexity, analysis of boolean functions
+ Provable machine learning: online learning
