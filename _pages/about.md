I am now a fourth-year PhD student in [Centre for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/) and [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My research interests are combinatorial algorithms, computational complexity, and learning theory. My Ph.D. advisor is [Miklos Santha](https://www.irif.fr/~santha/).

I am looking for a PostDoc position starting soon.

My Erd≈ës number is [3](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freetools/collab-dist?source=1525495&target=189017).
